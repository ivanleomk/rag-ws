{"question": "What is the 7D kill rate in cooking, and how does it change with temperature?", "answer": "The 7D kill rate in cooking refers to a process where food is cooked at a temperature and time sufficient to kill 10 million pathogens per gram of food, effectively reducing the pathogen population by 99.99999% (or 7 log cycles). For example, at a temperature of 140\u00b0F, it takes about 12 minutes to achieve a 7D kill rate, whereas at 160\u00b0F, it only takes around 7.3 seconds to achieve the same kill rate. These guidelines help ensure food safety according to USDA standards.", "chunk": "If you are cooking at high temps, carryover can be up to 10\u00b0F. If you are cooking at low temps, it might not go up the full 5\u00b0F. But 5\u00b0F is a good rule of thumb for most roasts. Medium rare is the best temp for beef, lamb, venison steaks, roasts, and duck breasts. Food scientists have equipment to measure tenderness and juiciness. But at that temp, it takes at least two hours to kill them to 7D. The time gets lower as the temperature goes higher. So beef at 140\u00b0F degrees will get to a 7D kill rate in just 12 minutes, while at 160\u00b0F degrees, pathogens are destroyed in just 7.3 seconds, hence the USDA guidelines for the consumer."}

{"question": "What are the differences in the roles of sporophytes and gametophytes in flowering plants and bryophytes?", "answer": "In flowering plants, the sporophyte comprises the entire multicellular body except for the pollen and embryo sac. The gametophytes are very reduced in size and are represented by the pollen and embryo sac. The sporophyte produces spores via meiosis or reduction division. In contrast, bryophytes have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition. The embryo sporophyte in bryophytes develops from the zygote within the female sex organ (archegonium) and is nurtured by the gametophyte during its early development.", "chunk": "In flowering plants, the sporophyte comprises the whole multicellular body except the pollen and embryo sac. Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition. The embryo sporophyte develops by cell division of the zygote within the female sex organ or archegonium, and in its early development is therefore nurtured by the gametophyte. In flowering plants the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the pollen and the embryo sac.

{"question": "Is it worth spending $120 annually on Lumosity?", "answer": "According to the text, spending $120 annually on Lumosity can be justifiable if you actively use it, comparing it to the cost of buying two new video games a year.

{"question": "How can I estimate closing costs for a mortgage loan in high-cost areas like New York or California?", "answer": "You can estimate closing costs for a mortgage loan in high-cost areas by multiplying the loan amount by 4 to 6 percent. For example, if you have a $300,000 loan, 4 percent of this amount is $12,000, and 6 percent is $18,000. Therefore, your estimated closing costs would range between $12,000 and $18,000. Your lender should provide a more precise figure when you apply for the loan.", "chunk": "I said you can get a pretty good idea how much your closing costs will be by multiplying the loan amount by 3 percent (or 4 - 6 percent in high-cost areas). Let's see how it holds up here. If I multiply $300,000 by .03, I would get $9,000. If I multiply by .04 (4 percent), I would get $12,000. On a $250,000 mortgage loan, this would come out to around $7,500 (250,000 x .03 = 7,500). If you live in a high-cost area like New York or California, you might have to multiply by 5 - 6 percent to get a ballpark figure. Your lender should tell you how much your closing costs are when you apply for the loan."}
{"question": "How can a homebuyer manage closing costs if they are short on cash?", "answer": "A homebuyer who is short on cash for closing costs can negotiate with the lender to pay part or all of the closing costs.

If you're short on cash for the closing costs and can't roll the closing costs into the mortgage, some lenders will pay part or all of the closing costs, but in exchange you'll have to pay a higher interest rate on the loan, perhaps 0.25% or 0.50% higher."}
{"question": "What are some strategies to manage closing costs when buying a home?", "answer": "One strategy to manage closing costs when buying a home is to negotiate with the seller. Typical closing costs amount to around 2-5% of the purchase price. For instance, on a $100,000 home, closing costs will be between $2,000 - $5,000. Considering a typical down payment of 20% ($20,000), it becomes clear why reducing closing costs is critical. One of the largest closing costs is points on a loan, which are equal to 1% of the total loan amount. For example, on a $100,000 mortgage, one point equals $1,000.", "chunk": "Method 1 of 4: Negotiate with the Seller. Typical closing costs are around 2-5% of the purchase price of the home. So on a $100,000 home, the closing costs will be between $2,000 - $5,000. Add this amount to a typical down payment of 20%, or $20,000, and it is easy to see why a home buyer would want to limit closing costs as much as possible. 1  1 Edit step. Points on a loan are one of the largest closing costs. Loan points are paid to the lender and are equal to 1% of the total loan amount. Points are also known as the loan origination fee.

{"question": "What are two ways to handle closing costs if you are short on cash when taking a loan?", "answer": "If you are short on cash when taking a loan, you can either add the closing costs to the loan amount or have the lender cover some or all of the closing costs in exchange for a higher interest rate.", "chunk": "If you don't have enough cash to pay the closing costs, you can often get the closing costs added to the amount of the loan. For example, if the loan amount is for $150,000, and the closing costs are $4500, you'd add the closing costs to the loan amount so you'd actually be borrowing $154,500 total. This is handy if you're short on cash after making your down payment. If you're short on cash for the closing costs and can't roll the closing costs into the mortgage, some lenders will pay part or all of the closing costs, but in exchange you'll have to pay a higher interest rate on the loan, perhaps 0.25% or 0.50% higher."}

It is advised to check your owner's manual for the specific recommendation for your vehicle. If a mechanic suggests a much shorter interval like 3,000 miles, it's worth asking questions.", "chunk": "Oil chemistry and engine technology have improved to the point that most cars can go several thousand more miles before changing the oil, Mr. Reed said. A better average, he said, would be 7,500 between oil changes, and sometimes up to 10,000 miles or more. So before you go in for your oil change, dig out your owner\u2019s manual and see what it says. And when the mechanic slaps on a sticker that gives the next change date in 3,000 miles, ask questions. And then, go get the car washed. That\u2019s one thing that always seems to be needed."}
